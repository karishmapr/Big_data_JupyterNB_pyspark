# Big_data_JupyterNB_pyspark
The current repository includes the classroom exercises done as a part of MSc degree for Big Data Tools and Techniques.
It involves exercises like : <li>
  1. <a href = 'https://github.com/karishmapr0103/Big_data_JupyterNB_pyspark/blob/master/Paired_RDD.ipynb'> Paired RDDs </a>: Using key value paired RDDs to carry out complex operations. In this case, character counting is carried out to compute frequency of each character. <li>
    <a href = 'https://github.com/karishmapr0103/Big_data_JupyterNB_pyspark/blob/master/Spark_SQL.ipynb'> Spark SQL </a> : Carrying out SQL operations using Spark. For the current exercise three implementations are used: Dataframes, SQL table and RDDs.
